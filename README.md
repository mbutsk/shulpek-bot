# Shulpek bot

A simple Telegram bot (in russian) for playing Shulpek - an Uno-like card game.

Invite the bot to any chat and enter /invite to play.

Use inline mode to choose the cards and do actions in the bot.

## Rules

When the 1st round starts, a random player is chosen. That player plays first.

On each card you can drop any card with the same suit or value - just like in Uno.

The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.
The other player gets the sum of all their cards' points added to their score.

Then another round starts, but the current turn will be on the player that won the last round.

The first to reach 105 points loses.

### Special cards

- `6` - opponent skips the turn and takes 2 cards.
- `7` - opponent skips the turn.
- `A` - opponent skips the turn and you can drop any of your cards on top of it.
- `Q` - you can use this card on any other card. When chosen, lets you change its suit to any other.

Also, if you only have Queens `Q` left in your hand, you can flush using them and substract the sum of all the Queens's points from your score.

### Points/costs of cards

- `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10` - 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 points respectively
- `J` *Jack* - 2 points
- `Q â™ ` *Queen of Spades* - 40 points
- `Q` *Any other queen* - 20 points
- `K` *King* - 4 points
- `A` *Ace* - 11 points
